# Kaggle-Flight-Dataset
 Udacity BS Tableau Project - Telling Stories with Data
I used Kaggle's 2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations dataset for my final project in Udacity's Business Analytics nanodegree program. Updates were made to increase viewer accessibility (***blue & orange!***) and allow me to tell my first stories in Tableau.

My insights can be viewed here.
