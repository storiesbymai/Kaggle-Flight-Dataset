# Kaggle-Flight-Dataset
I used Kaggle's 2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays) for my final project in Udacity's Business Analytics nanodegree program. Updates were made to increase viewer accessibility (***blue & orange!***) and allowed me to tell my first stories in Tableau.

My insights can be viewed here.
